# statwebgen
A simple static website generator, geared towards text-heavy content. I use it for my persal website, found [here](www.jellepelgrims.me).

## Dependencies
   * [Python-Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown)

## Commands

* To generate a static webite from the source directory:

          $statwebgen.py build

* To locally serve the generated website:

          $statwebgen.py serve

* To publish the generated website to GitHub (commit to repo):

          $statwebgen.py publish "%comment%"


## Usage
Statwebgen can be configured by creating a JSON file in the application folder, containing the project's name, the input directory, the output directory, and possibly a list of directories that will be ignored:

~~~~JSON
{
    "PROJECT_NAME": "project",
    "INPUT_DIR": "c:\\...", 
    "OUTPUT_DIR": "c:\\...", 
    "EXCLUDE_DIR": []
}
~~~~

A new static site project requires the following files in the input directory:
   * A template file called 'template.html' (if no template file is found, the default template found in the application directory will be used)
   * A stylesheet called 'style.css' (as specified in the default template)
   * A favicon called 'favicon.ico' (as specified in the default template)
   * A folder called 'posts' to store new blog posts
   * A folder called 'javascripts' to store any javascript code

The site's layout and styling (including sidebar contents) can be changed by editing the template and the stylesheet.

A new webpage can be added by creating a new markdown file in the input directory. The markdown file should at the very least contain the required meta-information:

   * **Type:** either 'page' for random website pages or 'post' for blog posts
   * **Title:** page title 
   * **Category:** page category (used for generating a blog page containg a list of all blog posts)
   * **Description:** page description (used in the html 'description' meta-tag)
   * **Created:** page creation date (DD/MM/YYYY)
   * **Updated:** last update (DD/MM/YYYY)
   * **Javascript:** a comma-delimited list of scripts that should be included

Page content should be added one line after the meta-information. For example, an about page should look as follows:
~~~~
Type: page
Title: About
Category: None
Description: About page.

My name is Jelle Pelgrims. I'm a university student in Belgium working on some personal projects in my free time. I have experience in the following subjects:

   * Software development in Python and C#
   * Web development in HTML/CSS/JS
   * Automated trading and game development
   * Economical theory, modelling and simulations
   * Dutch, English and Swedish
~~~~

The static website can then be generated by simply running the command *'$statwebgen.py build'* in the shell. All markdown files found in the input directory (and subdirectories) will automatically be converted to html and saved in the output directory. All non-markdown files will be copied to the output directory. File hierarchy is maintained during site generation.
