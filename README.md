# statwebgen
A simple static website generator. I use it for my persal website, found [here](http://www.jellepelgrims.com).

## Features

*   Create static websites from markdown files
*   Jinja2 templating
*   Automatic site rebuilding (no need to rebuild after every change)
*   Basic webserver for testing included
*   Automated publishing to github (with git)

## Commands

If no project or path is specified then statwebgen will try to use the present working directory.

**To create a new website:**

~~~
statwebgen.py --create [--skeleton SKELETON] [--project PROJECT] [path]
~~~

   * If a *project skeleton* is specified then the new project will be created from the skeleton.
   * If a *project name* is specified then the project and the associated project path will be saved in the config file.
   * If no path is specified the current working directory will be used instead

**To rebuild a static webite:**

~~~
statwebgen.py --build [--watch] [--project PROJECT] [path]
~~~

The *--watch* argument will automatically regenerate the website on changes.

**To serve a website:**
~~~
statwebgen.py --serve [--open] [--watch] [--project PROJECT] [path]
~~~

The serve command will try to serve from the *.build* folder by default (if a project name is specified). The *open* option opens the served website in the default browser. The *watch* option automatically rebuilds the websites if any files are changed.

## Usage

A new webpage can be added by creating a new markdown file in the project directory. The page's layout and styling can be changed by editing the used templates and/or stylesheets.

The markdown file can (but is not required to) include meta-data for usage in template files. To use meta-data tags in html templates, simply place an '$' character followed by the tag's name in the template and statwebgen wil automatically replace it with the tag's value.

The following meta-data tags are recognized and used by statwebgen. They will be replaced by default values if no value is set:

   * **Template:** the template file that is used.
   * **Stylesheets:** a comma-delimited list of css stylesheets that will be applied to the used template
   * **Scripts:** a comma-delimited list of scripts that should be included

Meta-data loading ends when a "---" string is encountered. Page content should be added after this string. For example, an about page could look as follows:
~~~~
Template: page.html
Title: About
Description: About page.
Created: 01/11/2016

Scripts: [default.js, somescript.js]

My name is Jelle Pelgrims. I'm a university student in Belgium working on some personal projects in my free time. I have experience in the following subjects:

   * Software development in Python and C#
   * Web development in HTML/CSS/JS
   * Automated trading and game development
   * Economical theory, modelling and simulations
   * Dutch, English and Swedish
~~~~

The static website can then be generated by simply running the *build* command in the shell. All markdown files found in the project directory (and subdirectories) will automatically be converted to html and saved in the output directory. All non-markdown files will be copied to the output directory. File hierarchy is maintained during site generation. 

By default all files in folders (if present) starting with a dot ('.') will be ignored while building and publishing.

### Dependencies
   * [Python-Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown): markdown to html conversion
   * [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/): templating
